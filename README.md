# Movie Industry Data Analysis Project

## Project Description

This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis using Python. It focuses on exploring and visualizing trends in the movie industry. Using a comprehensive dataset of movies, I conducted an in-depth analysis to extract meaningful insights about factors influencing movie success.

## Key Features

1. Data importation and initial exploration using pandas
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and data type conversions
3. Correlation analysis between various movie attributes (budget, gross earnings, ratings, etc.)
4. Visualization of trends and relationships using matplotlib and seaborn
5. Feature engineering to extract additional insights (e.g., extracting release month from date)
6. Statistical analysis to identify significant factors affecting movie performance

## Skills Demonstrated

- Python programming
- Data manipulation with pandas
- Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
- Statistical analysis and interpretation
- Handling and cleaning real-world datasets
- Feature engineering and data transformation

## Project Highlights

This analysis provides insights into:
- The relationship between movie budget and gross earnings
- Trends in movie ratings and their correlation with financial success
- The impact of release timing on movie performance
- Variations in movie success across different genres and production companies

## File Structure

- `Untitled-1.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis

## Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scipy (for statistical tests, if used)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed and the required libraries
3. Open `Untitled-1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
4. Run the cells to see the analysis and visualizations

## Data Source

The movie dataset used in this project is sourced from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies)].

## Key Findings
 
- Votes and budget have the highest correlation to gross earnings.
- Company has a low correlation which contradicts our initial assumption

## Future Work

- Incorporate machine learning models to predict movie success
- Analyze the impact of actor/director popularity on movie performance
- Expand the dataset to include more recent movies and additional features
